I take pride in designing and developing the website www.ieeegaza.org as part of the IEEEGAZA initiative. I utilized many modern design techniques to enhance the user experience and highlight the aesthetics in a unique way. The website features a responsive and beautiful design, where I applied numerous CSS effects to give it a dynamic and modern feel.

For example, I integrated sliding effects and gradient colors to achieve a dynamic and innovative appearance. Additionally, I used IFRAME to embed interactive content such as videos, with a background video placed on the homepage, adding a distinctive and aesthetic touch to the site. These design elements not only enhance the look but also contribute to smooth navigation and a seamless user experience.

The site includes several main pages:

    Home: This page introduces the initiative, outlining its purpose and the contributions of the team that played a key role in its success.
    
    Job Opportunities: This page provides job opportunities for Gaza residents, with a registration form allowing individuals to apply for jobs remotely from anywhere in the world.
    
    Educational Resources: It hosts a comprehensive collection of all the courses and workshops offered, along with a scientific library and research papers published by Gaza residents.

I used modern techniques to create a design that meets the website's needs and presents its features in a cohesive and mobile-friendly manner.

I want to thank everyone who supported the initiative and contributed to its success, and I hope this website remains an important reference for the achievements we've made.
